			<p>Whilst at Streamliners, a major focus of the work has been a move towards a cloud-based microservice architecture.
			I've been really engaged by exploring the benefits and opportunities of serverless solutions for quickly developing software solutions. 
			Leading design and implementation of these technologies gave me a first hand look at the advantages (and disadvantages!) of building and deploying cloud solutions.
			I've gained a huge respect for the potential for these tools to empower development teams and, quite honestly, it excites me greatly.
