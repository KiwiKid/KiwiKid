			Whilst at Streamliners, a major focus of the work has been a move towards a cloud-based microservice based architecture.
			I've been really engaged by exploring the benefits and opportunities of serverless solutions for quickly developing really complex software solutions. Leading the design and implementation of these technologies gave me a first hand look at the advantages (and disadvantages!) of building and deploying cloud solutions.
			I've gain a huge respect for the potential for these tools to empower development teams and, quite honestly, its excites me greatly.
