			<p>During the pandemic, the New Zealand Ministry of Health published the locations of interest, the locations of interest were published via a address list, but wasn't mapped, searchable, sharable, or mobile-friendly (fair enough, they were busy!). 
			I identified the need and published this app to provide a mobile-friendly view of these locations of interest. </p>
			<p>To spread awareness, i extended the app to include a reddit bot that would post to relevant subreddits when a new location was added or updated.</p>
			<p>With these efforts, the NZCovidMap reached over 200,000 Kiwis across New Zealand, with a peak of 15,000 daily unique visitors. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>- 4.5k users in the first month</li>
				<li>- 15k daily unique visitors</li>
				<li>- 200k total visitors</li>
				<li>- Circle-based location selection method</li>
				<li>A Mobile-friendly map view</li>
				<li>- Location specific url pathing query params + "share link to location"</li>
			
				<li>- Generation of location-specific meta screenshots for engaging social media preview images.</li>
				<li>- Reddit Integration - Including Auto-Generate & Update of a "Location of Interest summary" for each subreddit & auto-post/update posts in relevant subreddit</li>
			</ul>

							<li>An endpoint (also n8n) that returns all the locations in the last 30 days.</li>
							<li>A statically rendered Next.JS site that is published each hour. A mobile-friendly interactive map with all locations marked.</li>
							<li>A hourly job to build sub-reddit content and sent updates to places with new/updated Locations of Interest.</li>
							<li>Self-referential automatic meta image generation</li>

						<h1 class="is-size-2 has-text-weight-bold mt-4">Why so complex?</h1>
						<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
							<p>To reduce the complexity, cost and on-going maintenance cost of the application, i removed the n8n workflow the Next.JS site build on and replaced it with direct calls to the MoH API.</p>
							<p>This allowed the site to be fully independent of my own local infrastructure and for its whole lifetime, run entirely for free on Vercel</p>
