							<li>An endpoint (also n8n) that returns all the locations in the last 30 days.</li>
							<li>A statically rendered Next.JS site that is published each hour. A mobile-friendly interactive map with all locations marked.</li>
							<li>A hourly job to build sub-reddit content and sent updates to places with new/updated Locations of Interest.</li>
							<li>Self-referential automatic meta image generation</li>

						<h1 class="is-size-2 has-text-weight-bold mt-4">Why so complex?</h1>
						<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
							<p>To reduce the complexity, cost and on-going maintenance cost of the application, i removed the n8n workflow the Next.JS site build on and replaced it with direct calls to the MoH API.</p>
							<p>This allowed the site to be fully independent of my own local infrastructure and for its whole lifetime, run entirely for free on Vercel</p>
